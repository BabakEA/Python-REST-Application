# Python-REST-Application
In this project, you can see how to create a REST application using Flask library. 
The application will generate the ML model if it does not exist and then will serve flask to run a realtime data classification. 
Using this approach, you will be able to test your model in the semi-production level:) 

how to run :  

so simple :) 
python app.py 

The trained model will be saved as a pkl file in the model folder. Don't worry if you don't have this file yet. It's going to be created once you run the application :) 

As always, 
Happy coding
